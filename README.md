# Spending Tracker

A minimal React web app for tracking expenses and income and visualizing the balance with Highcharts. This project avoids package installation by relying on [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/) CDNs for React and Highcharts.

## Getting Started
Open `public/index.html` in a modern browser with internet access. You can add transactions and see a basic chart of your daily balance.

## Development
This repository provides only a lightweight frontâ€‘end example. It does not include persistent storage or a build setup.
